# Task 1 Implementation Recap: Cloudflare Infrastructure Setup

**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Task**: Set up Cloudflare account and domain infrastructure
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Summary

Successfully completed all infrastructure setup for deploying SwapWatch on Cloudflare's edge network. Established Cloudflare account, registered domain, configured security settings, connected GitHub repository to Pages, and authenticated local development environment with Wrangler CLI. The infrastructure is now ready for Workers and Durable Objects deployment.

### 8. Git Repository Updates

**.gitignore Additions:**
```
# Cloudflare
.wrangler/
.dev.vars.local
.mf/

# Vercel
.vercel

# Next.js
.next/
out/

# Zone Identifier files (Windows)
*.Zone.Identifier
```

## Technical Achievements

### DNS Configuration
- Nameservers successfully delegated to Cloudflare
- SOA record active (jakub.ns.cloudflare.com)
- DNSSEC configured automatically
- A records will populate on first deployment

**Verification:**
```bash
dig @1.1.1.1 swapwatch.app
# Returns SOA record with Cloudflare nameservers
```

### API Token Setup
- Custom token created with minimal required permissions
- Token exported as $CLOUDFLARE_API environment variable
- Token verification successful via curl

**Verification:**
```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/user/tokens/verify" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API"
# {"result":{"status":"active"},"success":true}
```

### Local Development Environment
- Wrangler CLI installed via pnpm
- OAuth authentication completed
- Account access verified
- Ready for local Worker development

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Full (Strict) SSL Mode
**Decision**: Use "Full (strict)" instead of "Full" or "Flexible"
**Rationale**: Maximum security with valid certificates from Cloudflare Pages/Workers

### 2. Paused Auto-Deploy on Pages
**Decision**: Pause automatic deployments during feature branch development
**Rationale**: Prevents build failures while codebase is in active development

### 3. Deferred HSTS Configuration
**Decision**: Skip HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) until after first successful deployment
**Rationale**: HSTS is irreversible and should only be enabled after confirming HTTPS works completely

### 4. Commented Routes in wrangler.toml
**Decision**: Comment out custom routes until Worker is deployed
**Rationale**: Routes require active Worker and DNS A records to function

### 5. Environment Variable Strategy
**Decision**: Use .dev.vars for local, Cloudflare dashboard for production
**Rationale**: Follows Cloudflare best practices and keeps secrets secure

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Template Selection Confusion
**Issue**: Cloudflare dashboard showed Worker templates (Astro, React Router, etc.)
**Solution**: Skipped template selection; will deploy custom Worker via Wrangler CLI
**Learning**: Dashboard templates are for generic apps; custom implementations use CLI

### Challenge 2: Missing Zone DNS:Edit Permission
**Issue**: Setup guide incorrectly listed DNS:Edit as required permission
**Solution**: Removed from requirements; not needed for Workers/Pages deployment
**Learning**: Workers Routes permission sufficient for custom domain routing

### Challenge 3: DNS Not Resolving Immediately
**Issue**: `curl https://swapwatch.app` failed with "Could not resolve host"
**Solution**: Normal behavior; A records created after deployment, not registration
**Learning**: Nameserver delegation ≠ A record creation; latter requires deployed service

### Challenge 4: Pages Build Failure Expected
**Issue**: Cloudflare Pages failed to build feature branch
**Solution**: Paused auto-deploy; feature branch in active development
**Learning**: Pages auto-deploy should be paused during development phases

## Verification & Testing

### ✅ Account Verification
```bash
wrangler whoami
# Account ID: e1e56a9592128ebad1f2b3a1fffda26b
# Email: mayuga.keenan@gmail.com
```

### ✅ DNS Verification
```bash
dig @1.1.1.1 swapwatch.app
# SOA record present
# Nameservers: jakub.ns.cloudflare.com
```

### ✅ API Token Verification
```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/user/tokens/verify" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API"
# Status: active ✅
```

### ⏳ Pending Verification (After Deployment)
- SSL certificate accessibility via browser
- A record resolution
- Custom route functionality (api.swapwatch.app)
- WebSocket endpoint connectivity

## Performance Metrics

**Setup Time**: ~2 hours total
- Automated configuration: 10 minutes
- Manual account setup: 30 minutes
- Domain registration: 5 minutes
- Security configuration: 15 minutes
- Troubleshooting & documentation: 60 minutes

**Cost**: $10-15/year (domain only)
- Cloudflare account: Free
- Workers free tier: 100,000 requests/day
- Pages: Unlimited bandwidth
- Durable Objects: 400,000 requests/month free

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Task 2)
1. Implement RoomDurableObject class
2. Create WebSocket handler with hibernation
3. Set up room state storage (KV + SQL)
4. Implement 24-hour expiration with alarm API
5. Test locally with Miniflare

### Short-term (Tasks 3-4)
1. Deploy Worker with Durable Objects
2. Create A records automatically via deployment
3. Migrate UI folder to root directory
4. Deploy Pages with edge runtime

### Long-term (Task 5)
1. Enable custom routes for api.swapwatch.app
2. Integrate WebSocket connections end-to-end
3. Test real-time swap broadcasting
4. Enable HSTS after successful HTTPS deployment

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Cloudflare's Auto-Configuration is Powerful
Nameservers, SSL, and DNSSEC configured automatically upon domain registration, significantly reducing setup complexity.

### 2. Documentation Prevents Confusion
Creating comprehensive setup guides (CLOUDFLARE_SETUP.md, SSL_SECURITY_SETUP.md) clarified process and prevented errors.

### 3. Template Selection Not Always Needed
Dashboard templates are for generic apps; custom implementations deploy better via CLI with full control.

### 4. DNS Propagation Requires Patience
Nameserver delegation instant, but A record creation requires deployment. Setting realistic expectations prevents confusion.

### 5. Development Branch Strategy Matters
Pausing auto-deploy during active development prevents unnecessary build failures and dashboard noise.
