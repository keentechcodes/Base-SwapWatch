## Technical Notes

**Security Implementation:**
- The signature verification was specifically adapted for CDP's current alpha implementation, which sends the webhook secret directly rather than an HMAC signature
- The system maintains backward compatibility with standard HMAC verification for testing

- All 32 tests pass successfully
- Efficient event processing with minimal latency
- Optimized DEX router lookup with normalized address matching

**Documentation:**
- Complete README with setup instructions and usage examples
- CDP webhook configuration guide with troubleshooting
- Example payloads and test scripts for development

The webhook demo application is now fully complete with robust webhook receiving, security verification, advanced swap event detection capabilities, and comprehensive documentation and development tools.
