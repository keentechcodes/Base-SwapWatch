# Webhook Demo App - Project Recap (2025-09-03)

## Spec Context

Built a minimal webhook receiver application to test core Coinbase Developer Platform webhook functionality for monitoring wallet swap transactions. This demo validates webhook integration with signature verification and basic event processing using ngrok for local development tunneling, providing console-based swap event logging without requiring database storage or complex UI.

## Completed Features Summary

### Task 1: Project Foundation and Webhook Server ✅ COMPLETE

Successfully established the core infrastructure for the webhook demo application:

**1.1 Test Infrastructure**
- Implemented comprehensive test suite using Jest and Supertest
- Created 7 test cases covering server endpoints, configuration, and middleware
- All tests passing successfully

**1.2 Node.js Project Setup**
- Initialized TypeScript-enabled Node.js project
- Configured strict TypeScript compilation settings
- Set up proper module resolution and build pipeline

**1.3 Express Server Implementation**
- Created Express server with foundational endpoints:
  - `GET /` - Service information endpoint
  - `GET /health` - Health check with uptime tracking
- Implemented proper JSON parsing with 10MB limit
- Added 404 and error handling middleware

**1.4 Environment Configuration**
- Created comprehensive `.env.example` with all required variables:
  - Server configuration (NODE_ENV, PORT)
  - CDP API credentials placeholders
  - Webhook secret configuration
  - Ngrok and monitoring settings
- Proper environment variable loading with dotenv

**1.5 Request Logging Middleware**
- Implemented color-coded request logging using chalk
- Logs include timestamps, HTTP methods, URLs, and response status codes
- Console output formatting for better development experience

**1.6 Test Verification**
- All 7 test cases pass
- Test coverage includes endpoint functionality, error handling, and middleware behavior

## Current Project Status

**COMPLETED: 1 of 5 major tasks (20%)**

- ✅ Task 1: Project foundation and webhook server
- ❌ Task 2: Webhook receiver endpoint (not implemented)
- ❌ Task 3: Webhook signature verification (not implemented) 
- ❌ Task 4: Swap event parsing (not implemented)
- ❌ Task 5: Development tools and documentation (not implemented)

## Technical Implementation Details

**Technologies Used:**
- TypeScript with strict compilation
- Express.js for web server
- Jest + Supertest for testing
- Chalk for colored console output
- Dotenv for environment management

**Key Files Created:**
- `/home/keenwsl/Documents/baseproject/src/server.ts` - Main Express server
- `/home/keenwsl/Documents/baseproject/src/__tests__/server.test.ts` - Test suite
- `/home/keenwsl/Documents/baseproject/package.json` - Project configuration
- `/home/keenwsl/Documents/baseproject/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript settings
- `/home/keenwsl/Documents/baseproject/.env.example` - Environment template

## Next Steps

To complete the webhook demo application, the following tasks remain:

1. **Implement webhook receiver endpoint** - POST /webhook with payload processing
2. **Add signature verification** - HMAC validation for security 
3. **Create swap event parser** - Detect and format CDP webhook swap events
4. **Build development tools** - Ngrok integration and setup documentation

The foundation is solid and ready for the remaining webhook-specific functionality to be implemented.
