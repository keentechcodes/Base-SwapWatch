# Post-Task 3 Implementation Recap: Webhook Architecture & Documentation
**Date:** October 6, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Type:** Architecture Finalization & Documentation

## Summary
After successfully deploying the Worker API (Task 3), we finalized the webhook architecture implementation, conducted a security audit, and created comprehensive documentation for the single webhook endpoint with dynamic filter management approach.

## Context
Following Task 3 completion and production deployment, we needed to:
1. Finalize the webhook architecture decision
2. Secure all credentials before public repository push
3. Document the implementation for developers
4. Create operational tools for webhook management

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Single Webhook Architecture
**Decision:** Use ONE webhook endpoint for all rooms instead of webhook-per-room
**Rationale:**
- Avoids CDP webhook quota limits
- Simplifies maintenance
- Enables wallet sharing across rooms
- Cost-effective at scale

**Implementation:**
```
Coinbase CDP (with filters) → Single Webhook → KV Index → Multiple Rooms
```

### 2. Dynamic Filter Management
**Decision:** Automatically update CDP webhook filters via API
**Approach:**
- When wallet added → Update KV index → Update CDP filters
- When wallet removed → Update KV index → Update CDP filters
- Graceful fallback to server-side filtering if CDP API unavailable

## Implementation Components

### Core Files Created/Modified

#### 1. Wallet Index System
**File:** `src/worker/wallet-index.ts`
- Bi-directional KV mapping (wallet ↔ rooms)
- O(1) lookup performance
- Automatic cleanup on room expiration

#### 2. CDP Webhook Manager
**File:** `src/worker/cdp-webhook-manager.ts`
- Dynamic filter synchronization with CDP
- Batch filter updates
- Fallback to server-side filtering

#### 3. Room API Integration
**File:** `src/worker/room-api.ts`
- Wallet operations trigger index updates
- CDP filter sync on changes
- Maintains consistency between systems

#### 4. Webhook Utility Script
**File:** `cdp-webhook-utils.sh`
- CLI tool for webhook management
- Create, update, delete webhooks
- Debug and recovery operations

## Security Audit Results

### Critical Issues Found & Fixed
1. **6 files with hardcoded credentials** - All removed
2. **Test scripts with API keys** - Deleted
3. **Production secrets in scripts** - Moved to environment variables

### Security Measures Implemented
- ✅ All credentials moved to `.env` (local) or Wrangler secrets (production)
- ✅ Created `.env.example` with placeholders
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` with security patterns
- ✅ Created `SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md` for ongoing security

### Files Cleaned
```
Deleted:
- scripts/cdp-webhook-manager.js (had API keys)
- scripts/test-cdp-direct.js (had API keys)
- scripts/test-cdp-sdk-auth.js (had API keys)
- scripts/test-cdp-webhooks.js (had API keys)

Updated:
- cdp-webhook-utils.sh (now uses env vars)
- set-production-secrets.sh (prompts for values)
```

## Configuration Updates

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Added to .env
CDP_API_KEY_NAME=<api-key-id>
CDP_API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY=<api-secret>
CDP_WEBHOOK_ID=<webhook-id>
WEBHOOK_SECRET=<webhook-secret>
```

### Worker Secrets Set
```bash
✅ COINBASE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
✅ CDP_API_KEY_NAME
✅ CDP_API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY
✅ CDP_WEBHOOK_ID
✅ TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
✅ BASESCAN_API_KEY
```

### DNS Configuration
```
✅ api.swapwatch.app → Worker (production)
✅ staging-api.swapwatch.app → Worker (staging)
```

## Testing & Verification

### API Endpoints Tested
```bash
✅ GET /health → {"status": "ok"}
✅ POST /room/{code}/create → 201 Created
✅ POST /room/{code}/wallets → Triggers index update
✅ DELETE /room/{code}/wallets/{addr} → Triggers index update
✅ POST /webhook/coinbase → Signature verification working
✅ WebSocket upgrade → CORS headers present
```

### Webhook Flow Verified
1. CDP sends event → Webhook endpoint
2. Signature verified ✅
3. Wallet extracted ✅
4. KV index queried ✅
5. Rooms notified ✅

## Operational Capabilities

### Monitoring
```bash
# Real-time logs
wrangler tail --env production

# KV index status
wrangler kv key list --namespace-id <id> --prefix wallet:

# Webhook status
./cdp-webhook-utils.sh list
```

### Management Tools
- `cdp-webhook-utils.sh` - Webhook CRUD operations
- KV index inspection via Wrangler
- Health check endpoints
- Debug commands documented

## Performance Metrics

### System Limits
- **Wallets per room:** 20 (configurable)
- **Rooms per wallet:** Unlimited
- **Total tracked wallets:** Millions (KV scale)
- **Webhook events/sec:** 1000+ (Worker auto-scales)

### Cost Analysis (1000 rooms)
- Worker requests: ~$5/month
- KV operations: ~$10/month
- Durable Objects: ~$15/month
- **Total:** ~$30/month

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Push to GitHub (credentials secured) ✅
2. Monitor production deployment
3. Test with real wallet activity

### Task 4 Preparation
- Frontend ready to integrate with API
- WebSocket endpoints operational
- CORS configured for web access
- Authentication can be added later

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Single webhook architecture simplified implementation
- KV index provides efficient routing
- Dynamic filters reduce unnecessary traffic
- Documentation-first approach helped clarify design

### Challenges Overcome
- Initial confusion on webhook architecture approach
- Security audit revealed hardcoded credentials
- CDP webhook configuration required manual setup
- DNS propagation delays during testing

### Best Practices Applied
- Never hardcode credentials
- Use environment variables consistently
- Document architecture decisions
- Create operational tools early
- Test security before repository push
