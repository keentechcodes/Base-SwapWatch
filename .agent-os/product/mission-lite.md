# Product Mission (Lite)

SwapWatch is a real-time blockchain monitoring application that helps crypto traders and DeFi enthusiasts track wallet swap activities by providing instant notifications when specific wallets execute token swap transactions on Base network.

SwapWatch serves crypto traders and protocol analysts who need immediate visibility into on-chain swap activities across multiple wallets. Unlike traditional block explorers that require constant manual checking, SwapWatch delivers instant webhook notifications specifically for swap transactions, enabling faster reaction times and automated trading workflows with enterprise-grade reliability through Coinbase's infrastructure.
