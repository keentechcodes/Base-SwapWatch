# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Cloudflare Deployment Architecture
> Created: 2025-09-27
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Deploy the SwapWatch application entirely on Cloudflare's edge infrastructure using Cloudflare Pages for the frontend, Workers for API endpoints, and Durable Objects for room state management with native WebSocket support. This architecture eliminates the need for external Redis, provides global edge performance, and operates entirely within Cloudflare's free tier for applications under 100 DAUs.

## User Stories

### Small Trading Group Deployment

As a crypto trading group organizer, I want to deploy SwapWatch without managing servers or databases, so that my group can start tracking wallets immediately with minimal infrastructure costs.

When I deploy SwapWatch to Cloudflare, the entire application runs on the edge network closest to my users. Room state is managed by Durable Objects which provide both storage and WebSocket coordination in a single primitive. The application costs nothing to run at small scale due to Cloudflare's generous free tier, and automatically scales globally if usage grows. WebSocket connections hibernate when idle, eliminating costs during inactive periods while maintaining persistent connections.

### Developer Maintaining the Application

As the developer maintaining SwapWatch, I want a simple deployment pipeline with automatic scaling and no operational overhead, so that I can focus on features rather than infrastructure.

With Cloudflare's architecture, I push code to GitHub which automatically deploys to Cloudflare Pages. The Workers handle API requests at the edge, Durable Objects manage room state without external databases, and everything is versioned and rolled back easily through Cloudflare's dashboard. Monitoring, analytics, and DDoS protection are built-in, requiring no additional configuration or services.

### User Accessing from Any Location

As a user accessing SwapWatch from anywhere globally, I want fast response times and real-time updates regardless of my location, so that I can monitor swaps effectively.

Cloudflare's edge network serves the application from the nearest data center, providing sub-50ms response times globally. WebSocket connections are established to the nearest edge location, and Durable Objects ensure consistent room state across all regions. The application remains responsive even under load due to automatic scaling and edge caching.

## Spec Scope

1. **Cloudflare Pages Setup** - Deploy Next.js frontend to Cloudflare Pages with edge runtime compatibility and environment variable configuration
2. **Workers API Implementation** - Create edge-compatible API using Workers for webhook processing and tRPC endpoints
3. **Durable Objects Architecture** - Implement room state management using Durable Objects with native storage and WebSocket hibernation
4. **Domain and SSL Configuration** - Register domain through Cloudflare Registrar and configure SSL with automatic renewals
5. **Development Workflow** - Establish local development with Wrangler, GitHub Actions deployment, and environment management

## Out of Scope

- Multi-region data replication (Durable Objects handle this automatically)
- Traditional database setup (D1, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker)
- CDN configuration (built into Cloudflare Pages)
- Load balancing setup (automatic with Workers)
- Backup and disaster recovery (handled by Cloudflare)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Application accessible at swapwatch.app with automatic SSL, serving the Next.js frontend from Cloudflare Pages with <50ms global response times
2. Room creation and WebSocket connections work through Durable Objects, maintaining state without external Redis and supporting 100+ concurrent users per room
3. Complete deployment from `git push` triggers automatic build and deploy through Cloudflare Pages CI/CD with zero-downtime updates and instant global propagation
