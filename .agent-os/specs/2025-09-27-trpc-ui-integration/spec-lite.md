# Spec Summary (Lite)

**⚠️ SUPERSEDED** - This spec has been replaced by the Cloudflare Deployment Architecture (see @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-27-cloudflare-deployment-architecture/). The UI integration concepts remain valid but the backend uses Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects instead of Node.js/tRPC/Redis.

~~Integrate the Orchids.app-generated UI with a TypeScript tRPC backend to create a fully functional room-based wallet tracking application. This integration connects the terminal-inspired frontend to real-time blockchain swap data through type-safe API calls and WebSocket subscriptions, enabling crypto trading groups to collectively monitor wallet activities on Base network using shareable room codes with 24-hour lifecycles.~~
